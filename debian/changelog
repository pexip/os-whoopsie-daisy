whoopsie-daisy (0.1.33) precise-proposed; urgency=low

  * Continue to process the existing crash reports every two hours, not
    just once after two hours (LP: #1205374).

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 29 Jul 2013 17:16:42 +0100

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.32) precise; urgency=low

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.30) precise; urgency=low

  * Stop rejecting legal arguments to the postinst (LP: #978436). Thanks

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.29) precise; urgency=low

  * Mark reports as complete when we get a HTTP response of 400 from the
    server, as these represent the server not liking what we sent it.
    Sending these again repeatedly would be pointless (LP: #979082). 

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 11 Apr 2012 17:36:32 +0100

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.28) precise; urgency=low

  * Create /var/crash if it doesn't already exist. Don't silence the
    chmod and chgrp calls on it. Thanks Colin Watson (LP: #978502)!

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 11 Apr 2012 09:44:12 +0100

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.27) precise; urgency=low

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.26) precise; urgency=low

  * Take ownership of the NetworkManager state variant on setup and
    unref it, plugging a memory leak.
  * Log the reason the server rejected the submitted crash report.
  * Send the Whoopsie version with each crash submission.
  * Delete both .upload and .uploaded files after 14 days. Thanks
    Marc Deslauriers (LP: #973687).

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.25) precise; urgency=low

  * Stop using a queue to monitor reports that need to be processed.
    Just iterate over the reports that have a .upload file, but do not
    have a matching .uploaded file.
  * Set the GSettings backend to memory to avoid pulling in DConf when
    we call into GNetworkMonitor.
  * Split out the /var/crash monitoring code and add tests for it.
  * Plug some memory leaks.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 29 Mar 2012 23:30:39 +0100

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.24) precise; urgency=low

  * Add the file listing of /var/crash to whoopsie bug reports. Taken
    from apport's package hook.
  * Fix cppcheck call in make check.
  * Monitor network connectivity using NetworkManager and GNetworkMonitor.
    Do not report being online and able to report crashes if the user only
    has 3G or dial-up connectivity, or if there is no route.
  * Do not upload crashes multiple times if the file attributes for
    their .upload files change while on the report queue.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 29 Mar 2012 11:37:51 +0100

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.22) precise; urgency=low

  * Do not leak the file descriptor of our lockfile.
  * Do not leak a file descriptor when marking a report as handled. Add
    a test for the mark_report function.
  * Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in report tests.
  * If allocated with g_malloc, free with g_free.
  * Add cppcheck to make check, but only when it's installed.
  * Plug a memory corruption bug (hopefully). g_queue_find_custom
    returns a *link* not a list, so do not try to hand it back to the
    slice allocator as if it were a list.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 23 Mar 2012 14:17:43 +0000

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.21) precise; urgency=low

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * debian/rules: make sure dh_installinit knows about our upstart job, so
    we get correct start/stop/restart handling on install/removal/upgrade.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Disable the network detection for now, to help in tracking the
    source of a memory corruption bug.
  * Clean up option parsing a bit.

  * Handle errors in changing the filename extension, even when we're
    pretty sure we have an extension.
  * Handle errors in g_file_get_path.
  * CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION may be called successively. Grow a string with
    each call to account for this.
  * Add an apport hook for attaching the stderr output when run under
    upstart.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 22 Mar 2012 15:22:51 +0000

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.19) precise; urgency=low

  * Handle errors in parsing the crash database URL.
  * Do not double-free the crash database core submission URL when a
    system UUID is not present (LP: #960972).
  * Handle errors in bson_append_string.
  * Handle more BSON error conditions.
  * Handle empty values in the apport format ("KeyName:\n")
    (LP: #960766, LP: #960737, LP: #960751).

  * Handle multiple crashes of the same binary by watching the
    modification times on the .upload and .uploaded files.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 12 Mar 2012 17:06:26 +0000

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.14) precise; urgency=low

  * Do not include 'base64 ' on the front of any base64-encoded field.
  * Check the return value of asprintf.
  * CURLOPT_VERBOSE expects a long.

  * Output a better error message if the daemon is not started as root.
  * Do not keep trying to process reports that cannot be parsed.

    settings can be found under the 'Diagnostics' tab in Privacy.

 -- Evan Dandrea <ev@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 23 Feb 2012 15:01:18 +0000

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.10) precise; urgency=low

  * Add a cron job (run daily) to clean up the .upload and .uploaded

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.8) precise; urgency=low

  * Security fixes. Thanks Jamie Strandboge for the review.
    - Check the return value of the open call in get_system_uuid.
    - Properly initialize libcrypt.
    - Check that the call to gcry_md_open succeeds
    - Ensure that reading the SHA512 message digest succeeds.
    - Protect against changes to the message digest length creating a
      security vulnerability.
    - Check the returncode of setenv.
    - Use /var/lock/whoopsie instead of /tmp/.whoopsie-lock.
    - umask is usually called before fork.
    - Future-proof by using getrlimit instead of explicitly closing STD*
    - Redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null.
    - Ensure strings created in update_to_crash_file are NULL-terminated.
    - Only process regular files in /var/crash.
    - Replace calls to *alloc with g_*alloc, which calls abort() on
      failure.
    - Remove unused system_uuid pointer.
    - Fix warnings in make check.
    - Initialize all of curl.
    - Redirect stderr to null in chgrp and chmod calls.
    - Set home directory to /nonexistent.
    - Enable libcrypt secure memory.
    - Put the lock file in /var/lock/whoopsie/.
    - Sanity check the CRASH_DB_URL environment variable.
    - Added tests:
      - Check handling of embedded NUL bytes.
      - Verify that symlinks in /var/crash produce the correct error
        message.
      - Verify that keys without values in reports produce an error message.
      - Ensure that the report does not start with a value.
      - Correctly identify a report without spaces as malformed.
      - Verify that directories in /var/crash produce the correct error
        message.
      - Ensure that blank lines in a report are treated as errors.
      - Ensure that carriage returns are escaped.
      - Do not start multi-line values with a newline.
      - Check that a valid report has the exact expected contents.
      - Ensure that other variants of embedded carriage returns are escaped.
      - Verify that reports without a trailing newline are handled properly.
  * Change crash database URL to http://daisy.ubuntu.com.
  * Main inclusion request approved (LP: #913694).

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.4) precise; urgency=low

  * Write the system UUID to the UserOOPS ColumnFamily.
  * Drop the CAP_FOWNER stuff.  As James points out, we can just write a
    .uploaded file and let cron clean up the mess.

    connectivity check.
  * Ensure in the postinst that whoopsie can read crash reports in
    /var/crash.
  * Isolate whoopsie into its own mount namespace, dropping all privileges and
    capabilities but CAP_FOWNER, so that we can delete files in /var/crash even
    though it's +t.
